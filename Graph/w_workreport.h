Work Report

      Features:

        -Not Implmtd:   Complete search was not implemented
                        from point a to b, I did not have enough time
                        this weekend and had to juggle a bunch of
                        assignments


        -Implemented:   Edges changed to weighted
                        Edges changed to dynamic
                        Labels changed to dynamic

                        Templated class for Edges
                        with dynamic 2d array/capacity/realloc

                        Dijkstra's Algorithm
                        -Gives the Shortest Path
                        -Gives the Shortest Distance

                        Search
                        -Depth First (from book)
                        -Breadth First (from book)
                        cycles through available nodes



        -Partly implemntd:
