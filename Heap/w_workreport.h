    Bugs     : no bugs afaik

    Comments: Alas, the comment section

    This project has taught me to never underestimate
    the apparent simplicity of a certain function

    so then, regarding this,

    I had tested my vector class,
    and it is now without any bug, and it was actually
    bugless before too.

    I had tested my library, and it was also bugless

    this actually took like 5 hours of my morning and
    4 hours after class

    what the actual problem was,
        that...
        that...
        ...yeah, i never figured it out,
        i had rewritten this entire project,
        hence the heap being renamed to
        heap_re for rewrite

        and it had then probably been fixed through it all

    I would also love to stress that,
    as a human, friendship is the most important concept
    and having people be there to help you solve a problem
    on their free time is a great privilege.
